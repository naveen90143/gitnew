Version Controlling
=======================
This is the process of maintianing multiple versions of the code
All the team members uplaod their code(check in) into the remote
version controlling system.The VCS accepts the code uplaods from 
multiple team members and integrates it so that when the other
team members download the code they will be able to see the entire
work done by the team

VCS's also preserve older and later versions of the code so that
at any time we can switch between which ever version we want

VCS's also keep a track of who is making what kind of changes

======================================================================

VCS's are categorised into 2 types
1 Centralised version controlling
2 Distributed version controlling

Centralised Version controlling
-----------------------------------
Here we have a remote server(code repository) into which all the team 
members check in the code and all the features of version controlling
are implemented in this remote server

 Distributed version controlling
-------------------------------------
Here we have a local repository installed on every team members machines
where version controlling happens at the level of individual team members
form where it is uploaded into a remote server where version cotrolling 
happens for the entire team

====================================================================
Setting up git on Windows
-------------------------------
1 Download git from
  https://git-scm.com/downloads

2 Install it

3 Open gitbash and execute the git commands

======================================================================
Setting up git in ubuntu linux servers
--------------------------------------------
1 Update the apt repository
  sudo apt-get update

2 Install git
  sudo apt-get install -y git

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring user and email globally for all users on a system
git config --global user.name "sai krishna"
git config --global user.email "intelliqittrainings@gmail.com"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
On the local machine git uses three sections
1 Working directory
2 Stagging Area
3 Local repository

Working directory is the location where all the code is created
Initially all the files present here are called as untracked files

Stagging area is the location where file indexing happens and it 
is the buffer area of git and the files are called as indexed files

Local repository is where version controlling happens and the files
are called as commited files


==========================================================================
1 To initilise the working dir as a git repo
  git init
  This will create a hidden folder called .git where
  it will store all configurations for git to work

2 To send a file into from working dir to stagging area
  git add filename
  To send multiple files
  git add file1 file2 file3
  To send all files
  git add .
  . represents current working dir

3 To bring files from stagging area to working dir
  git rm --cached filename
  (or)
  git reset filename

4 To send files from stagging area to local repository
  git commit -m "Some msg"

5 To check the status of working dir and stagging area files
  git status

6 To see the commits done on the local repository
  git log
  To see this output in simple one line format
  git log --oneline

==================================================================
.gitignore
================
This is a special configuration file that is used to
store private files info.Any file whose name is stored in
.gitignore will not be accessed by git

1 Create few file
  touch file1 file2 file3 file4

2 Check the git status
  git status
  It will show the above 4 files as untracked

3 Create .gitignore and store the above 4 filenames in it
  cat > .gitignore
  file1
  file2
  file3
  file4

5 Check the status of git
  It will no longer show file 1-4
